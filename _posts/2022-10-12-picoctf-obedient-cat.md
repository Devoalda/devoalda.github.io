# Description
This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear").

# Process 
The flag was downloaded on a Windows machine (*probably not a good idea*), using notepad++ to view the file, the flag was found in the file.

However, using the `cat` command on a Linux machine, the flag should also be found.

# Flag
